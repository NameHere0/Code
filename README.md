## Code

This repository includes code I either do for fun, learning, or bettering myself at code. 
>  This repository isn't meant to be downloaded or anything, it's just version control for my folder (in case anything goes 14.43º diagonally)




## Installation 

As I said, this isn't meant to be downloaded or installed...
### But if you really want this, use the classic
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Gameing8921/Code.git
```

>You need git to do this, if you somehow didnt know

>goto [this website](https://git-scm.com/install/windows "Git install website")  for **windows**


>run `brew install git` for **macos** (run `/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"` to install brew if you havent)

>use `apt install git` for **debian** (or your distro's equivalent)


##  Why is this public

Because **why not**?, Why not make this public, why not share my wacky code (that will make your eyes bleed upon reading)? 
> This also makes it easier to ask ppl to review my code or smth idk




>i luv blockquotes
